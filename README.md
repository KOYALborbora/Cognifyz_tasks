**Task 1: Predicting Ratings (Regression)**

* **Goal:** Estimate a restaurant's overall rating based on other data (e.g., location, price range).
* **Steps:**
    1. **Clean Up Data:** Handle missing values and convert categories (cuisines) to usable formats.
    2. **Train a Model:** Use machine learning to learn the relationship between features and ratings.
    

**Task 2: Recommendation System (Content-Based)**

* **Goal:** Suggest restaurants that match user preferences (e.g., cuisine, price).
* **Steps:**
    1. **Prepare Data:** Clean and format data for user preferences and restaurant features.
    2. **Define Criteria:** Decide what factors influence recommendations (cuisine, price, etc.).
    3. **Recommend Similar Restaurants:** Based on preferences, suggest restaurants with similar features.
    

**Task 3: Cuisine Classification**

* **Goal:** Automatically categorize restaurants based on their cuisine types (e.g., Italian, Thai).
* **Steps:**
    1. **Data Prep:** Clean and format data, including cuisine labels.
    2. **Train a Model:** Use machine learning to learn to distinguish between different cuisines.
    3. **Evaluate Performance:** See how accurately the model classifies restaurants into cuisines.

**Note:** This is a general overview. Refer to the code and any additional documents for specifics.

**Explore More:** Consider expanding the system with collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches.
